# Grocery List Web App

This is my first self-driven project using GitHub. The goal is to create a simple and modern grocery list web application using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with no backend or external database. All data is stored locally in the browser using `localStorage`.

## Project Context

- **Purpose:** Help users manage their grocery shopping lists easily and visually.
- **Technologies:** HTML, CSS (with Material Design components), JavaScript (ES6+), and browser `localStorage`.
- **Features:** Create, edit, and delete shopping lists and items, mark lists/items as completed, and track item prices and total cost.

## Main Changes and Features Implemented

- **Initial Setup:** Created the project structure with `index.html`, `lista.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js`.
- **Material Design Integration:** Added Material Symbols and Material Web Components for a modern UI.
- **List Management:** Users can create, edit, and delete shopping lists.
- **Item Management:** Inside each list, users can add, edit, and delete items.
- **Completion Status:** Added the ability to mark lists and items as completed, using a check circle icon instead of a checkbox.
- **Price Tracking:** Introduced a price field for each item and display the total sum of all item prices at the bottom of the list.
- **Local Storage:** All lists and items are saved in the browserâ€™s `localStorage`, so no backend is required.
- **Dialog Handling:** Improved dialog behavior for adding/editing lists and items, including cancel actions.
- **Styling:** Ensured consistent font usage and icon rendering, with custom CSS for Material components and total price display.

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in your browser (preferably using a local server).
2. Create a new shopping list.
3. Click on a list to add items, including their prices.
4. Mark items as completed and see the total price update automatically.
5. All your data is saved locally in your browser.
